**Authors:**


- Alejandro Vidales Esquivel: He received the B.Sc. degree in Electronic Engineering from Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo (UMSNH), Morelia, Mexico, in 2021, 
and the M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from UMSNH in 2025. His research focuses on harmonic analysis of ECG signals, development of state observers for system estimation,
biomedical signal modeling, and the application of machine learning techniques for computer-based medical diagnosis.
- Fernando Ornelas Tellez: He received the B.Sc. degree from the Instituto Tecnologico de Morelia (ITM), Morelia, Mexico, in 2005 and the M.Sc. and D.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Advanced Studies and Research Center, National Polytechnic Institute (CINVESTAV-IPN),Guadalajara, Mexico, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.
Since 2012, he has been with the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo, where he is currently a professor of Electrical Engineering graduate programs. 
His research interest centers on optimal control, neural control, sliding modes control, and passivity, and their applications to smart grids, power electronics, mechanical systems, and electrical machines.
- Jose Ortiz Bejar: He received the Ph.D. degree in data science from INFOTEC, Unidad Aguascalientes, in 2020. He is currently an associate professor with the Michoacan University of San Nicolás de Hidalgo. He has served as an Organizer of ROPEC and IEEE T\&DLA conferences. 
His research interest centers on machine learning applied to power systems analysis, text categorization, and clustering.

Description of files: The database used in the study is attached.
An example of the estimator in mathematica is included.
The main code is provided, which calls the 'armonicos_v2.slx' file to perform the harmonic estimation.
After that process, the main code calls the 'clasificador_armonicos.slx' file, which is responsible for generating the final prediction.
